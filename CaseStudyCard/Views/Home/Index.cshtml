    <div style="width=70%;padding-top:50px">
        Here's the card checker, click the 'Tool' button above to begin.<br />
        <br />
        Application forms are stored, and the system also has the ability to show multiple cards. However, I didn't have time to find out the best
        implementation for storing & showing one-to-many relationships. Therefore,
        cards that are shown have their ID stored as a string in the ApplicationForm class. Future work would have me show the ID of the page as a
        clickable link in the Form view, redirecting to what they saw.
        <br /><br />
        I still need some time to get my head around using Dependency Injection, but I think I have a good idea of its' purpose.

        Thanks,        <br />
